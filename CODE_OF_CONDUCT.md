# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and maintainers of **branch-clean** pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best for the community and the project

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including the issue tracker, pull requests, discussions, and any other communication channels used by the project. It also applies when an individual is representing the project in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project maintainer. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

The project maintainer is obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

### Enforcement Actions

Project maintainers may take any action they deem appropriate, including:

1. **Correction** - A private, written warning providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate.
2. **Warning** - A warning with consequences for continued behavior, including a defined period of no interaction with the people involved.
3. **Temporary Ban** - A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the project community.
4. **Permanent Ban** - A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the project community.

## Maintainer Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing the standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.
